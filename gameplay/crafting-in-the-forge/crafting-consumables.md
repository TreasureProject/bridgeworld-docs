# Crafting Consumables

Legions can use [Treasures](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures) to craft two types of [Consumables](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables) in Bridgeworld: [Prisms](crafting-consumables.md#prisms) and [Metabolic Boosters](crafting-consumables.md#metabolic-boosters). Each crafting recipe has its own difficulty, costs, time to completion and XP gained.

<table><thead><tr><th width="187">Consumable</th><th width="111">Difficulty</th><th width="132">MAGIC cost</th><th width="133">Time to craft</th><th>XP gained per craft</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Prism</td><td>Level 1</td><td>2.5 MAGIC</td><td>12 hours</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Metabolic Booster</td><td>Level 4</td><td>2.5 MAGIC</td><td>24 hours</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table>

Each recipe also requires a certain amount of Treasures of each tier, which have the possibility of [breaking during crafting](crafting-consumables.md#treasure-break-rates-during-crafting):

<table><thead><tr><th width="193">Consumable</th><th width="76">Tier 1</th><th width="74">Tier 2</th><th width="75">Tier 3</th><th width="77">Tier 4</th><th>Tier 5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Prism</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Metabolic Booster</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Prisms

All Legions can craft Prisms. When crafting Prisms, Legions have the chance to receive one of the following types of Prisms:

* [Small](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/1): 90% drop chance
* [Medium](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/2): 9% drop chance
* [Large](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/3): 1% drop chance

### Upgrading Prisms

Legions can use [Essence of Starlight](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/8) and [Prism Shards](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/9) to upgrade the size of their Prisms. The price of upgrading varies based on the level of Corruption in the Forge (see below table). The price decreases as Corruption increases to encourage players to upgrade Prisms to remove more Corruption when corruption is high. Upgrading Prisms requires 48 hours to complete.&#x20;

| Forge Corruption Level    | Cost                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0 - 100,000               | 700 EOS + 700 Prism Shards |
| 100,000 - 200,000         | 600 EOS + 600 Prism Shards |
| 200,000 - 300,000         | 500 EOS + 500 Prism Shards |
| 300,000 - 400,000         | 400 EOS + 400 Prism Shards |
| 400,000 - 500,000         | 300 EOS + 300 Prism Shards |
| 500,000 - 600,000         | 200 EOS + 200 Prism Shards |
| 600,000 - 1,000,000 (max) | 100 EOS + 100 Prism Shards |

## Metabolic Boosters

Metabolic Boosters give your Harvester a _temporary_ boost to its mining power. A maximum of 10 Metabolic Boosters can be deposited to a Harvester at once. Legions must be Crafting Level 4 or greater in order to craft a Metabolic Booster.

There are 3 types of Metabolic Boosters (small, medium, large). See below for the likelihood a Legion crafts a certain size of Metabolic Booster and their associated boost they will have in Harvesters.

| Metabolic Booster                                           | Drop Chance | Mining Boost % |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| [Small](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/4)  | 0%          | 20%            |
| [Medium](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/5) | 90%         | 25%            |
| [Large](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/6)  | 10%         | 30%            |

## How many Crafting Points are needed to level up? <a href="#how-many-crafting-points-are-needed-to-level-up" id="how-many-crafting-points-are-needed-to-level-up"></a>

Legions can reach a maximum Crafting Level of 6. Increasing Legions' Crafting Level enables them to craft more difficult recipes.

## Treasure break rates during Crafting <a href="#treasure-break-rates-during-crafting" id="treasure-break-rates-during-crafting"></a>

When crafting Consumables, Treasures have a chance of breaking. Broken Treasures are sent to the World Treasury, where they will be recycled and re-distributed for quests.

With the exception of Grin and Honeycomb, Treasuresâ€™ likelihood of breaking are based on their Tier. Treasures break during the process required to extract and apply the MAGIC at their core to Legions' crafts. Legions who break a Grin or Honeycomb report feeling a tremor that shakes the very foundation of Bridgeworld, an [Essence of Grin](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/13) or [Honeycomb](https://app.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/12) in the debris.

<table><thead><tr><th width="347">Treasure</th><th>Probability of Treasures breaking during crafting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures/95">Grin</a>/<a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures/97">Honeycomb</a></td><td>0.498%</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures?trait%5B%5D=Tier%3A1%3A1">Tier 1</a></td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures?trait%5B%5D=Tier%3A2%3A2">Tier 2</a></td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures?trait%5B%5D=Tier%3A3%3A3">Tier 3</a></td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures?trait%5B%5D=Tier%3A4%3A4">Tier 4</a></td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://app.treasure.lol/collection/treasures?trait%5B%5D=Tier%3A5%3A5">Tier 5</a></td><td>15%</td></tr></tbody></table>

100% of a recipe's MAGIC cost is consumed. Additionally, all the Treasures used in the recipe have a chance of breaking. Example for a **prism recipe:**

* The ingredients required are 2x T3, 2x T4 and 2x T5 Treasures
* They have a 9%, 12% and 15% to break, respectively
* The RNG is repeated for each Treasure. If the RNG hits the corresponding threshold probability, your Treasure breaks and is burned.
