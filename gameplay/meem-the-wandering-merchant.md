# Meem, The Wandering Merchant

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Not much is known about Meem’s past, only that Meem’s recently taken interest in Bridgeworld collections and will randomly appear throughout the week to offer deals on various consumables:

* Periodically Meem the “Wandering Merchant” will appear around the ecosystem, starting with Bridgeworld
* Meem will offer you deals to convert various items into Prisms, Boosters, and other ecosystem items Meem may have collected throughout his travels.\


**During each visit, the deals Meem offers will vary in terms of:**

* What items Meem is seeking and willing to trade for.
* What items Meem is willing to offer in return, and how much on offer.
* When Meem appears, and when Meem disappears.
* How much inventory available each visit.

**\*\*Some deals may never be seen again.**
