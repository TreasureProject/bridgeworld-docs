## What is corruption?

Corruption is a toxic substance that is continually seeping into Bridgeworld structures (Ivory Tower, Forge, Harvesters) bit-by-bit. Corruption slows down game loops, and MAGIC Harvesters find.

Corruption flows into the Ivory Tower and Forge at a rate of 4,000/hr and 1,333/hr into each Harvester.&#x20;

## Impacts of Corruption on Bridgeworld

Corruption can impact each of the below structures in Bridgeworld with varying effects as more corruption compounds or is removed from Bridgeworld structure.  The max amount of corruption that can enter into each Bridgeworld structure is 1,000,000. \


### Ivory Tower

Corruption not only diminishes the chances of finding treasure fragments, but also prolongs the duration of legions being trapped in stasis, increases questing times, and the number of corrupted cells in the Treasure Triad.\
\
Assuming a starting treasure fragment drop rate of 5% and a corruption level of 250,000, the resulting drop rate for treasure fragments would be 4.8% after applying a slight decrease of 0.2% (calculated as 5% multiplied by 0.96). View drop rates [here](https://bridgeworld.treasure.lol/quest/embark).&#x20;

| Corruption Levels | Impact on Quests           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0 to 100,000      | +10% Treasure drop rate    |
| Above 100,000     | Stasis: +1 hour            |
|                   | Default Treasure drop rate |
|                   | Quest Time: +1 hour        |
|                   | Corrupted Cells: 0         |
| Above 200,000     | Stasis: +2 hour            |
|                   | -4% Treasure drop rate     |
|                   | Quest Time: +2 hour        |
|                   | Corrupted Cells: 1         |
| Above 300,000     | Stasis: +3 hour            |
|                   | -8% Treasure drop rate     |
|                   | Quest Time: +3 hour        |
|                   | Corrupted Cells: 1         |
| Above 400,000     | Stasis: +4 hour            |
|                   | -16% Treasure drop rate    |
|                   | Quest Time: +4 hour        |
|                   | Corrupted Cells: 1         |

|                   | -48% Treasure drop rate    |
|                   | Quest Time: +6 hour        |
|                   | Corrupted Cells: 1         |





## Forge

The likelihood of treasures being damaged while crafting is heightened by the presence of corruption. Assuming a starting break rate of 5% and a corruption level of 250,000, the resulting break rate would be 7%.&#x20;

| Corruption Levels | Impacts on Break Rates |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Above 100,000     | No impact              |
| Above 200,000     | +2%                    |
| Above 300,000     | +4%                    |
| Above 400,000     | +6%                    |
| Above 500,000     | +8%                    |
| Above 600,000     | +10%                   |

## Harvesters

Corruption reduces the mining power of Harvesters.&#x20;

| Corruption Levels | Impacts on Harvester Mining Power Boosts |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Above 100,000     | 0.9x                                     |
| Above 200,000     | 0.8x                                     |
| Above 300,000     | 0.7x                                     |
| Above 400,000     | 0.6x                                     |
| Above 500,000     | 0.5x                                     |
| Above 600,000     | 0.4x                                     |
