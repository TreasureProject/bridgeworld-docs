# A New Adventure

The room is dark except for the one slash of light that drapes across your face, waking you.

You want to roll over, but the comfort of sleep is already retreating. The reality of the waking world calls to you. It takes a moment to orient yourself, and you don’t immediately remember where you are or how you got here. A vague memory lingers on the edge of your perception. A rowdy night at the old barracks cantina. Someone singing? A fight? A storm? You can’t quite grasp the details. Is it real or a dream?

You blink back to the waking world. With the rest of the room cloaked in darkness, you focus on the shaft of light. You reach for it.

Curtains part and the morning sunrise shines into your room. You can see Bridgeworld outside the window, but it all seems different somehow. The world outside is just starting to wake up. It could be a trick of the light or the haze of sleep still nagging at you, but everything seems so… new. You decide you need some fresh air.

You find yourself opening the door to a handwritten message. This is the information you have been waiting for. The instructions are clear. You must follow the path through the marketplace to the end of the road, and…

Wait, there’s a strange scroll on the back. You look more closely: “_MEEM WAS HERE_.” Of course Meem would be the one to bring you this information. Instinctively, you know information from Meem can be costly, but that also makes it extremely valuable, and _that_ could paint a target on your back, especially where you’re going.

You hurry through the marketplace. The sun is bright this morning. But wait, you seem to be in plenty of shade. Where is that other light source coming from? It is warm and powerful, but your eyes can’t quite focus yet. You should have stopped for breakfast, but the note was very clear. You must pursue this to the end.

The streets are getting more crowded now. More people than you are used to seeing. Many of them seem to be new arrivals, visitors from other lands. Some are easy to tell apart from the other residents of Bridgeworld, but others are not. Bridgeworld is always exciting in that aspect. Where do they come from and where are they going? And how are they getting here? The energy, the… power of Bridgeworld is drawing everyone in. It is also leading you down your path.

You follow the road until it ends at a dock. The morning ruby sun has turned to topaz, and it feels warm on your face, even as the cool morning breeze swirls by. You step out to the edge of the dock, and you see it. This is what you have waited for, what all of Bridgeworld has waited for, and it is finally approaching.

The promise of adventure.
