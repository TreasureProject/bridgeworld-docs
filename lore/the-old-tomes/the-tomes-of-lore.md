# The Tomes of Lore

Dear Reader,

If you're reading this, you're probably one of those people in search of answers, trying to work out what exactly has befallen you. Whether you spontaneously found yourself in a field, in the sea, on a boat - you've woken up in this land and there's no way back.

Yes, that much is clear: there is no way back.&#x20;

But there is a way forward.

To understand where you fit in this new world, what your purpose is and where your opportunities are, you must first understand the history of this world. Context is everything.

This Tome that you hold in your hand is a good starting point.

As with all stories, these are merely the recorded words of those who tell them. Memories fade and get rewritten in the minds that bear them over time, and even for us, it is difficult to draw a clear line between fact, fiction and mere embellishment.

It is up to you to make sense of the history that is told of this place, and if you so wish, write your share of this world's future.

All the best, Legionnaire.

Bridgeworld depends on you.

Yours Sincerely,

The Eminently Dignified Society of Bards, Writers and Artists
