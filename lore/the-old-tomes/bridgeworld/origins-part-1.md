# Origins: Part 1

“Don’t tempt fate!”

“Don’t say that, you’ll bring bad luck on us all!”

Have you ever stopped to wonder how it could be possible that one individual word, a tiny utterance, could change the outcomes of events so significantly that they cascade into world-changing consequences?

Almost as if by saying that specific thing, you’d triggered a cheat code in a game, only it doesn’t actually give you “God mode”, but rather delivers a inexplicable dump of bad fortune?

No wonder people believe we live in a simulation.

Or the multiverse.

Or the multi-simulation-verse?

Quantum physicists have for decades looked at the possibilities of the existence of a multiverse, as one of the potential ways of explaining phenomena that defy the very fundamentals of Newtonian mechanics.

It’s as if a couple of programmers came together and wrote multiple versions of code, ostensibly to do the same thing and create a sort of metaverse, but because the underlying syntax was all different, when you got to the nitty gritty bits of trying to understand how things work, the logic that sat at the surface just… falls apart.

Nothing makes sense if you think about it properly.

I mean, think about it: if civilisations advance over time, becoming ever more developed, how can it be that when we look to ancient civilisations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, Rome, the Incas and the Mayans, to name a few, they seem to possess this sophistication that is so blatantly absent today?

And where did all the brilliant composers like Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart and Bach disappear to? Was there a mass extinction event in the past century?

Nothing makes sense. Someone’s messing with us.

_“It seems like we have a potential situation on timeline 0x742016.”_

_“Do not be hasty, my brother. As you shall learn in time, these musings often fall short of the epiphanies required to discern our existence.”_

_“Has the existence Bridgeworld ever been discerned by them?”_

_“The Origin Enclave has watched upon the Bridgeworld since the beginning of time, as we are doing now. From the outside, we are nothing: a dimension in perpetual stasis, where time as they understand does not pass.”_

_“But we experience time, don’t we?”_

_“Indeed we do, but what is time but a point on a defined continuum? Our continuum is infinite in all dimensions, so why do we need time?”_

_“Perhaps. But surely in the infinity of time, some of these worlds must have discerned our existence, at least by inference, given the intelligence we have bestowed upon these beings?”_

_“You speak rightly, young one. It is at those times when the Legions are called upon to intervene, for a great disorder will befall all of these worlds if the Bridgeworld is discerned.”_

_“Don’t interventions seem somewhat blatant?”_

_“The Legions guide, govern and protect the Bridgeworld. For those who do not understand, their abilities are thought to be Magic. And so we allow it to be termed, for it is beyond the comprehension of many. The Legions leave in their wake legends, myths and relics — sometimes as rewards, sometimes as gifts and sometimes as warnings. You ask the right questions young one, and your questions I shall answer. You ask how these interventions go unnoticed? Well, as this individual we are currently observing has noted, history seems to be pieced together in a slightly disconnected manner.”_

_“Ah, yes, so we simply re-order the flow of time across multiple worlds, weaving a new timeline into existence, creating a new reality for those who remain? But surely there are parts of the story that need to be pruned, for the timelines to remain coherent?”_

_“You learn quickly, young one. We shall yet make a good legionnaire of you. That is enough for this epoch. Ponder your questions, for they are good questions, and you may very well discern the answers on your own.”_

_“Yes, my brother.”_
