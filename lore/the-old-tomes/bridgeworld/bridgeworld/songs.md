## Adventurers Bold

Adventurers bold step forth and claim you loot, magic, and gold. From foreign lands around the globe a thousand strong with thousands more to come. The magic flows from deep within, the mines are dug but can go deeper still. There’s treasures to be had and battles to be fought in a world born from nothing but shared thought. The day is young but the journey long remain steadfast and feel free to share this little song”



## The Adventurers' Call

“The dungeons, the dragons, the travelling bards. The shop keeps, the maidens, the King with concerns. The chemists, the smithies, the crafters and guards all await the heroes who heed adventurers’ call!”
