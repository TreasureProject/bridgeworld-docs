# Mysterious Merchant

They call him the Peddler: no one knows which lands he comes from, or if he is even of this world. But in the shadow of the Elm tree, one always finds him: ever ready with a price, ever ready with a deal to be done. No small number have returned with glorious artefacts that appear out of this world after an exchange with the peddler, exchanges sometimes done at the price of time itself.
