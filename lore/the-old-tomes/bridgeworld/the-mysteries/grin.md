# Grin

Treasures be found in the dungeons deep underground, from the shell of the Mollusk to the tail of a dragon, from the relics of old to rupees and gold. Pearls glisten atop feathers of red and immovable stones, fairies in jars and favours from the gods all can be found in the castle’s halls. Though deep underground where no one’s around and treasures abound the buzzing of bees is the only sound.

When you step through the hall and the magic is thicker a glimpse of honey might flicker. Now the hour is near pop your cap and disappear there’s been no sin but with that ivory pin who’s to say where you’ve been or if indeed you carry a little Grin.
