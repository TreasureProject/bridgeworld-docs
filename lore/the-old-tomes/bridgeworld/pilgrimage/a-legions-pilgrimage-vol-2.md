# A Legion's Pilgrimage, Vol 2

Chaos.&#x20;

The clarity Legion had felt just a moment prior was gone. Now all she felt and saw was chaos. She was falling through a churning mist. Spinning head over heels. Around her shimmering portals opened and closed with other legions flying out one portal into another. Up and down had no meaning. As she spun through the air she saw a shimmering portal open in front of her.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

For a moment she was an Assassin. Stalking her target.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

Out she flew of another portal. Back to being Legion for a mere moment before falling headfirst into another portal.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

Fighter, exchanging blows on floor of a colosseum.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

Siege, storming a castle door with hammer falling. _Flit_ Spellcaster, summoning balls of lighting and flame.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

A Grin in green eating a honeycomb.&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

A Black Plague Mask&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

With each portal she fell through Legion felt her soul twist and pull. The visions were too many. She closed her eyes against the chaos and sought peace within. She needed to find the clarity of her true self. Blocking out the visions and the dizzying fall, she tried to trace herself back, back to who she was before. She was a legion setting out on a pilgrimage, a teenage girl crying over a lost love, a child listening to their mother’s stories of fairies and magic.&#x20;

Wait! A tickle of a memory pushed its way forward. A kind woman’s voice. A story told over and over at the request of a child. “…and remember sweet one. If you ever find a silver penny, treasure it and keep it with you, for silver pennies are keys to the fairies realm. They open the door between their realm and ours.”

Legion's eyes snapped open. Did she still have it? As she tumbled through the air, her hands dived into her belt bags, searching for a treasure found long ago and kept. Knives, gems, bits of string and flint fell spinning out of her hands as she searched frantically. Finally, her hand closed on the cool smooth surface of a coin stamped with an M. She pulled out the silver penny and held it out in front of her as she fell towards another spinning shimmering portal. Her mind focused on the coin and a single purposeful thought.&#x20;

_Take me where I belong._&#x20;

_Flit_&#x20;

Ranged opened her eyes. She saw a clear sky and far in the distance a colossal structure of spinning arcs floating in the air. She felt soft grass beneath her and heard a soft giggling sound as if of small girls running and playing at a distance. Sitting up and looking around she saw a shaded wood off to her right. Between the trunks of the trees, she could make out blinking red, pink, and white lights, almost like fireflies had come out to shine and glow in broad daylight. Smiling to herself, Ranged got up and followed the lights into the wood. As she began to whistle a happy tune, it did not even occur to her to wonder where the silver penny had gone.&#x20;
