# The Riverman

In a futuristic desert apocalypse with dwindling resources…

Countries turned to extreme measures to survive. Police states were formed. Mass surveillance, central authority and loss of freedom was common in this world.

Countries fight each other for the most valuable resource known as “mines”. Mines, although scarce contain precious elements to be used to further ones war effort to secure dominance among one another. Conscription was common and only the rich and wealthy are protected from it. The rich jealously guard their status by manipulating the markets to secure their position. You are most likely destined into war. Death is looming around the clock. This is where I come in.

I am The Riverman and I guide spirits to the afterlife. I hear the stories of many before they reach the beyond.
