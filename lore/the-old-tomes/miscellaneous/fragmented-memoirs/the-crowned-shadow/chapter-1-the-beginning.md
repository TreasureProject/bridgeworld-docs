# Chapter 1 - The Beginning

For Vyn it seemed like any other day. The sun was shining, the birds were singing and he awoke with a yawn in his bedroom at his family's home. He went through his usual routine of waking up, getting dressed, heading downstairs to have breakfast.

But this particular morning something felt off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it. It wasn't anything specific, just an overall sense of unease. Something vague and nagging at the back of his mind, like the unpleasant recollection of a dream one can't quite remember on waking up.

He shrugged it off as the natural feeling that he had started to miss over time, that new level of apathy that he had grown accustomed to. He hadn't quite found his place in the world yet. His training as a warrior was going well, but he wasn't sure how he could use his newfound abilities.

Vyn had been taught his whole life that everyone had their own place and the sooner he found his place in this world, the better. His parents were devout followers of Trell and like many others, were keen on imparting some wisdom about the importance of finding your talents and following them to glory.

Vyn had studied the stories of the great founders and had always been intrigued by the mysticism of it all. How could people discover powers that they weren't even aware of? How were the greatest weapons of all time forged?

He wanted to be one who uncovered their legacies. He wanted to find it and make a name for himself.

He read all the books he could find, and followed to stories. Despite everyone's dismissal of his desire for questing, he knew one day he would find something... and then it happened...
