# Treasures From My Memories

Today is not the same \
As tonite

Today I was waiting for you \
Tonite you arrived

Today I glanced \
Took a chance \
Hoped you’d be there

Tonite I see you \
You have no clue \
A miracle I'd swear

Today is not the same \
As tonite

Today I was hoping \
My heart was simply coping \
Pining

Tonite I'm twirling \
And whirling, swirling \
Not a care

Today is not the same \
As tonite

Tomorrow if you’re gone \
It still won't be the same

I’ll have had the joy, ecstasy \
A moonlit memory, a whispered touch \
Today will never be the same \
As yesterday ever again

I'll never be the same again
