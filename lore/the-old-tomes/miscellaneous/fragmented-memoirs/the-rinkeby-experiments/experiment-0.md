# Experiment #0

DSA - 0&#x20;

As the portal light dimmed and I stepped into this new world I was greeted with two distinct sensations. One was the smell of salt rolling off the oceans. The other was the piercing shriek of the local primates.&#x20;

A quick glance let us know we’d interrupted their feast of some local fauna. Sadly, a few hadn’t made it away from the portal's nexus in time, we could see them limping away into the underbrush. One unfortunate specimen was smashed against a nearby tree. The pressure differential caused by the bridge must have knocked the ape some 10 meters away.&#x20;

Another was cradling its body, unaware of our presence. Jiro suggested we capture it now while the effects of the bridge were just setting in.&#x20;

We initially tried to coax it into an isolation chamber, but it showed clear signs of distress the moment we tried to move it away from its mate. Unfortunately, prolonged, overt exposure to a bridge would have done irreparable harm to its tiny body.&#x20;

After a brief discussion, we decided to take both specimens with us. Even dead we'll still learn a great deal about the planet's flora with a thorough dissection.&#x20;

DSA - 7&#x20;

Our dissection of C.2 was unremarkable. Flora and fauna here appear similar to other carbon-based planets we’ve bridged in the past. What remains to be seen is how the bridge will affect C.1 and his kin.&#x20;

We've started direct observation of our primate friend, nicknamed Rinkeby by engineer Manek. We gave his mate a brief burial and since then he's refused to leave our side. We've found this behavior inexplicable. Given the circumstances, we believed he'd attempt to escape and return to his kin in the forest nearby.&#x20;

Regardless, his willingness to stay nearby has provided excellent opportunities to study his development without having to delay our initial lab work and set-up.&#x20;

Subject C.1 - Rinkeby | Morning Entry&#x20;

Rinkeby has been a steady observer of everything Jiro and I do in the lab. When we take breaks, he finds someone in engineering or the kitchens to watch. In fact, if he could take notes I'd say he was observing us rather than the other way around.&#x20;

On our 4th day here, Rinkeby started to imitate engineer Manek as he did his routine maintenance. By the end of Manek's shift, Rinkeby had learned to do some of the simple steps like fastening bolts on his own.&#x20;

His curiosity is likely due to an increased mental capacity caused by the bridge. We've tried to make contact with his kin but they've been rather fearful of us; unwilling to accept food even when left out overnight. I can’t blame them. Thus far, our only interactions have involved death and kidnapping.&#x20;

Our working assumption is that the initial proximity to the bridge had a jumpstart effect on Rinkeby’s evolutionary process. The rest of the primates should eventually catch up.&#x20;

Tomorrow we're going to sit down and run a few intelligence tests. Jiro and I have asked Til and Rez to try and capture a few more if possible, but only if they believe it will not cause undue harm. We’d like to establish a working relationship as best as we can with such an underdeveloped species.&#x20;

Aside from that, this planet has been extremely hospitable. Food is abundant, there are adequate freshwater resources, and so far none of the local wildlife has threatened us.&#x20;

Brief reports from the crew - Manek has had no issues setting up our lab. Jiro, Til, and Rez finished the dissection yesterday and have taken a record of their findings. Tuhone guards our campsite without incident. We’ll send a report tomorrow after we finish testing Rinkeby.
