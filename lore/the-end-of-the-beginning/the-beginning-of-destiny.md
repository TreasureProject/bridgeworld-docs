# The Beginning of Destiny

A mighty BOOM! shatters the air. No, not a boom. More like a crack… or a rip. Yes, that’s it, a rip! That sound is the foundation of Bridgeworld tearing apart.

Each of the Five arrive to see it. Bombmaker has his weapons ready. Dreamwinder can sense its energy. Fallen revels in its destructive power. Clocksnatcher wants to know why. Warlock sees the future and the past colliding. They are all inexplicably attracted to it, not out of fear or concern or any sense of community, but by natural impulse. Every one of them has arrived here without any regard for the others. The storm at the center of it all seems to be unraveling the fabric of the world, and they are all compelled to be here to witness it.&#x20;

They are all drawn to what appears to be the source: The pointed diamond crystal hovers in the eye of the storm, at the center of everything. It appeared with the storm and just as suddenly as the storm itself. It could be the cause of the storm or something else brought here by the storm. Perhaps its meaning is something beyond them, but it is surely connected somehow.&#x20;

Without thinking, without seeing what the others are doing, they each reach out to it. They cannot consciously know if they are pursuing it or if it is drawing closer to them. Either way, there is no escaping it.

It is their destiny and their doom, and they all know they must reach it.
