# Getting Started

_Greetings, fellow travelers. You are invited to embark on a journey like no other. On this quest, you will venture into a fascinating new world, searching for coins, Treasures and other elements that can be combined into precious artefacts._

## Step 1 - Obtain MAGIC

In this world, MAGIC is the energy of the metaverse, and you must acquire some if you hope to gather fellowship.

To do so, simply go to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Trove marketplace</mark>](https://trove.treasure.lol/), connect to the wallet of your choice, and click “Buy MAGIC”.  Bridgeworld operates on Arbitrum. You will need to send funds to Arbitrum in order to purchase MAGIC _via_ the _"Buy MAGIC"_ button.

### What is MAGIC?

MAGIC is the natural resource of the Treasure metaverse. It powers the ecosystem of games on Treasure. MAGIC is designed to be increasingly scarce  as it weaves an ever-growing web of narrative bridges within the Metaverse. Players can obtain MAGIC through playing in Bridgeworld and across the Treasure ecosystem.&#x20;

### What is the Treasure Ecosystem? <a href="#what-is-the-treasure-ecosystem" id="what-is-the-treasure-ecosystem"></a>

The Treasure Ecosystem consists of games that share the same economic infrastructure which includes the reserve-currency (MAGIC), Marketplace (Trove) and in-game assets. The Treasure ecosystem is a part of Treasure, a decentralized game console.

## Step 2 - Obtain your character <a href="#step-2-forging-your-legion" id="step-2-forging-your-legion"></a>

Before you can embark on a quest, you must obtain a Legion.

There are 3 types of Legions:&#x20;

1\. **Recruit Legions** - The Barrack is where players can obtain a Recruit Legion to begin playing Bridgeworld. Recruits can be minted for 10 MAGIC. View [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/barracks) for details on Recruit Legions.

2\. **Auxiliary Legions** - Auxiliary Legions are better at questing and crafting than Recruit legions and can be used within Harvesters to find more MAGIC.

3\. **Genesis Legions** - Genesis Legions are the most powerful beings within Bridgeworld. They have strong abilities in finding Treasures and extracting MAGIC from Bridgeworld.

Head to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Trove marketplace</mark>](https://trove.treasure.lol/cartridge/bridgeworld) to purchase a Auxiliary or Genesis Legion. Here, you can trade in your MAGIC for Legions to join your company. Choose the warrior best suited to you, and being your quest!

## Step 3 - Embark on adventures! <a href="#step-3-embark-on-adventures" id="step-3-embark-on-adventures"></a>

Once your company is full, it’s time to set out for adventure!

There are four main paths to send your legions. Legions can questing for treasures and other rare elements, craft treasures and consumables, eliminate corruption in bridgeworld and gain a seat in a Harvester to find MAGIC across Bridgeworld. \


### Train a recruit Legion

By summoning others to your cause, you will be able to increase your party, and thus your chance of success in Bridgeworld.&#x20;

In the Barracks, you can acquire and train a Recruit Legion for a modest fee of 10 MAGIC. These Legions have restrictions in how they can be used in Bridgeworld compared to Auxiliary and Genesis Legions. With enough questing and crafting, a recruit can be promoted to an Auxiliary Legion!

### Quest for items

By traveling to the Ivory Tower, Legions can begin questing throughout Bridgeworld, gaining experience as they seek out valuable Treasures and items that can be used across Bridgeworld and the broader Treasure ecosystem.

Questing is the main way to find Treasures in Bridgeworld. As Legions go on quests, they will gain questing experience that will allow them to unlock more difficult quests. Questing is free and is how Legions earn Essence of Starlight, Prism Shards, and Treasure Fragments which can be crafted into Treasures.

### Craft new assets

At the Forge, Legions can take the items they’ve amassed through questing, and combine them into useful items that will aid in their adventures, as well as their journey of finding MAGIC.

As with Questing, your Legions will gain crafting points the more they use the Forge, which will allow them to unlock the ability to forge rarer and more valuable artifacts.

### Join a Harvester

Harvesters are ancient creatures that find and consume MAGIC across Bridgeworld. Legions have learned to harness the power of Harvesters by attaching Harvester Permits to them which divert the MAGIC they find and consume to themselves. View [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](https://docs.bridgeworld.treasure.lol/gameplay/harvesters) for more information on Harvesters.

### Fight Corruption

Corruption is a toxic substance continually seeping into Bridgeworld that makes questing longer, increases break rates during crafting and reduces the amount of MAGIC harvesters can find.

Legions can work to remove corruption that has seeped into the Ivory Tower, Forge, and Harvesters as well as harness the power of corruption to craft it and throw it against their opponents to gather more MAGIC.&#x20;
